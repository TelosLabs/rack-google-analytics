## 22 Jul, 2010

### Improvement

- Major re-write from Arthur Chiu, now correctly writes the `Content-Length` header, and comes with tests. ([@achiu][])
- This patch also backs-out the changes from [@cimm][] - but they were un-tested (I intend to bring these back as soon as possible; this will probably constitute a 1.0 release when it happens).

## 19 Jan, 2010

### Improvement

- Makes the default snippet the async version from Google. Use regular synchronous code with: `:async => false`. ([@ralph][])
